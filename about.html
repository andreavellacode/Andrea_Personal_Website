                        <p>During my time at the University of Malta, I completed two summer internships with Cleverbit Software through the MITA Student Placement Programme.</p>
                        <p>In my first summer, I underwent training in C#, the.NET framework, and unit testing, mainly via the Pluralsight website. I then gained hands-on experience with NET technologies, and also other tools such as Postman, while writing unit tests for their Inscope project for the rest of the summer.</p>
                        <p>The following summer I was placed on a different team, working on their recruitment application. Here I was given a larger variety of tasks, including researching feature feasibility and implementing minor features, mainly on the back-end. This role presented new challenges and further improved my software development skills.</p>
                        <p>I greatly value my time at Cleverbit Software as it provided a supportive environment and constant communication with my willing supervisors. Aside for this, I also spent a few months as an electrician's assistant, where I developed more discipline and adaptability, especially in uncomfortable situations.</p>
